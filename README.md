# IPL 2024 Player Performance – Data Visualization Task 🎯

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraftTechnology**.

Using Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I visualized the **top 10 batsmen's performance** in IPL 2024 based on their:
- Total Runs
- Batting Average
- Strike Rate
- Number of 100s & 50s

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🧮
- Matplotlib 🎨
- Seaborn 🌈

## 📌 Visualization
A colorful horizontal bar chart showing:
- Player names vs Runs scored
- Annotated stats (Average & Strike Rate)

The output plot is saved as:OUTPUT1.PNG
